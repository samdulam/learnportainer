## What is a Container Management?
Container management is the collective term for creating, deploying, and scaling application containers. It facilitates the organization, addition, and replacement of containers on a large scale.

Containers have become common as enterprises shift to DevOps and the cloud for faster software development and deployment. You can bundle everything needed to run the app, including files and libraries, into a container simplifying deployment and management for greater agility and faster delivery.

Container management solutions optimize the process of creating containers, increase efficiency, and streamline container delivery while eliminating complex interdependent system architectures.

## Why Do Containers Need Management?
Container management solutions vary, and therefore the outcomes differ. However, a container management solution generally solves three main problems; deployment, scaling, and monitoring.

+ **Deployment**

    Containers require deployment files for each criterion that defines the file’s deployment. For instance, it needs to know the memory (RAM), CPU, and storage units from where to source the relevant code. Container management solutions facilitate this process.

+ **Scaling**

    Container management solutions increase or withdraw resources as necessary to facilitate optimal container processing while maximizing resource utilization. For instance, the container management solution is responsible for availing additional RAM and processing speed depending on demand and resource availability.

+ **Monitoring**

    Finally, container management solutions monitor your environment for containers, performing automated health checks, rolling restarts, and maintenance to facilitate successful process completion. Otherwise, you may need to deploy independent monitoring tools.

## Why should I care?
To go “into production” with containers, **regardless of scale or use case**, you need a Container Management Platform. 
Either you take the time to self-assemble one from a plethora of open-source tools in the CNCF landscape, or you use Portainer; regardless, you must choose one.
